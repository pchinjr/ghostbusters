# Migrate from 2015 to 2020

This was my first template static site. I originally used this site to learn about CSS and HTML. The Javascript on this page was not altered very much from the original template. I developed it completely with Cloud9 IDE and hosted it on bitballoon. Since then, Bitbaloon was aquired by Netlify and Cloud9 was acquired by Amazon. 

I figured it would be a good exercise to take a look at what I did in 2015 and update it.
