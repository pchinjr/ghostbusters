# Migrate from 2015 to 2020

This was my first template static site. I originally used this site to learn about CSS and HTML. The Javascript on this page was not altered very much from the original template. I developed it completely with Cloud9 IDE and hosted it on bitballoon. Since then, Bitbaloon was aquired by Netlify and Cloud9 was acquired by Amazon. 

I figured it would be a good exercise to take a look at what I did in 2015 and update it. 

1. First thing I noticed is that file management could be much better. I'm pretty sure I just drag and dropped the folder called "multi-free-responsive-onepage-html-template" into a browser and it became a static hosted site. So restructuring the files and getting it deployed on Begin is the first step. 

2. The original site had a contact form, I need to update this so it will actually work. 

3. Make sure that images are saved and not hot-linked.
